Special recommendations for pharmacological treatment of insomnia. COMISA refers to co-occurring insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, while COPD denotes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clinical factors contributing to insomnia must be evaluated, including the type (sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, or early waking), weekly frequency, and time of occurrence; daytime symptoms associated with COMISA and obstructive sleep apnea should also be considered.
