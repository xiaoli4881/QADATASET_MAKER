Conducted by Nicasio and colleagues, 104 adult patients were tested for progressive relaxation and neurobiofeedback using electrodes in the frontal region versus simulated neurobiofeedback (placebo). Significant reductions in self-reported latency and depressive symptomatology were observed. However, this result did not show significant differences when compared with the control group, suggesting a potential placebo effect.

A similar result of a potential placebo effect was observed in a double-blind study on primary insomnia patients by Kwan and colleagues. A recent randomized study suggested that neurofeedback protocols were comparable to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); however, the small sample size precludes any conclusions regarding this.

Physical exercise with emphasis on aerobic practice is cited as an adjuvant therapy for insomnia treatment. It increases energy expenditure, promotes well-being, facilitates weight loss, and improves mood and cognition. One study tested a monitored program of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity (brisk walking) physical activity over six months. The physical exercise group showed an average reduction of four points in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score by the end of follow-up.

More recently, Baron and colleagues demonstrated that moderate to vigorous aerobic training for 12 weeks also improved insomnia symptoms severity.

Another investigation compared three to five times weekly aerobic exercise with implementing a balanced diet over six months in 72 patients. Both physical exercise and dietary interventions improved sleep quality and reduced objective sleep latency and efficiency relative to the baseline period; however, no significant differences were shown when compared with the control group.

Evidence on resistance or strength exercises is scarce but suggests benefits for both objective and subjective parameters of chronic insomnia patients. Meta-analyses point to safety and some favorable effects on insomnia symptomatology but report inconsistencies due to limited study quantity and quality (118-120).

Mind-body techniques, including meditative practices, yoga, tai chi, qigong, etc., aim to train the mind through contemplation or body movement. These ancestral practices focus on breathing to integrate mind and body. Studies involving these techniques have a frequency of one to three times per week (60-120 minutes per session) for 12 weeks or more.

Some studies evaluating yoga and tai chi point to improvements in sleep quality, certain parameters of sleep architecture, and psychiatry symptoms; however, evidence is limited due to small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, high response heterogeneity, and lack of standardized techniques (57, 121-124).

However, some studies have indicated that mind-body approaches improve dose-dependent sleep quality. The longer the practice, the greater the effect on sleep quality or decreased excitability (57, 86, 96). These results suggest such approaches can be adopted as preventive practices for insomnia in healthy and clinical populations and serve as adjuvants to CBT-I with or without comorbidity.

Aromatherapy is a therapeutic approach based on the principle that substances from essential oils release particles capable of generating favorable stimuli to brain areas related to emotions, helping treat symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Preliminary studies suggest aromatherapy (mainly using lavender) may have benefits for sleep quality in mild forms of insomnia.

Pharmacological treatment of insomnia today consists of several classes with different mechanisms of action; some are specific to certain types of insomnia. As detailed below, some classes have greater scientific support regarding safety and efficacy while others lack such evidence and are often used "off-label." In this guideline, we will divide the classes into items presented below.

Selective Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists (Z-drugs) Selective BZD receptor agonists marketed in Brazil include zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone. These constitute a class approved for treating insomnia as hypnotics.
Mechanism of action: Hypnotic agents from the imidazopyridine class act on the Î±1 subunit of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Immediate-release formulations have a short half-life (0.5 to 3.5 hours), with peak plasma levels occurring within one hour after administration.
