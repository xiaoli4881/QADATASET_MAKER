BZDs' history began in 1955 with the discovery of chlordiazepoxide and in 1963 with the launch of diazepam. The expectation for new drugs offering more effective and safer psychic effects than predominant barbiturates and opioids led to BZDs dominating the neuropsychopharmacology market from the 1960s through the early 1970s, until perceptions about these drugs began changing due to side effects such as abuse, addiction, and accidents after mid-1970s.

Although there has been a decline in prescription over the past two decades, BZDs remain popular with new formulations emerging as recreational drugs known as designer BZDs. Mechanism of action: They act as allosteric agonists of GABA-A type receptors by binding to different sites and facilitating the effect of the agonist neurotransmitter. This results in neuronal hyperpolarization through a cellular influx of chloride, primarily in postsynaptic neurons.

BZDs exhibit varying effects depending on their Î± subunits and locations within the central nervous system (CNS): anxiolytic; hypnotic; myorelaxant; amnesic; antiepileptic; and respiratory depressant. In the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, GABA inhibition in the ventral tegmental area increases dopamine signaling, leading to a reward effect associated with abuse and dependence.

Available presentations: Several BZDs are sold in Brazil for outpatient use aimed at treating insomnia. This study will evaluate oral and sublingual tablet formulations as well as drop bottles; injectable hospital-use forms such as intravenous or intramuscular administration, nasal spray, and rectal preparations will not be listed here.

The analyzed BZDs include bromazepam (3 mg; 6 mg oral tablets, 2.5 mg/mL solution), diazepam (10 mg oral tablets), clonazepam (0.25 mg sublingual tablets, 0.5 mg and 2 mg oral tablets, 2.5 mg/mL solution), alprazolam (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg oral tablets), midazolam (7.5 mg and 15 mg oral tablets), flunitrazepam (1 mg oral tablets), estazolam (oral tablets 2 mg), furazepam (30 mg oral tablets), nitrazepam (5 mg oral tablets), clobazam (10 mg and 20 mg oral tablets) and lorazepam (1 mg and 2 mg oral tablets). Notably, temazepam was excluded as it is the only BZD indicated for treating insomnia according to AASM guidelines but not available in Brazil.

Patient assessment: Due to their mechanism of action, BZDs have hypnotic potential for onset, maintenance; and early morning awakening insomnia. However, risks such as abuse, dependence, withdrawal, intoxication, enhancement of other substances with a hypnotic effect, accidents, and death mean that they are not drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia.

Therapeutic planning: BZDs can be sought only in cases where indicated (e.g., epilepsy, some psychiatric and sleep disorders) according to clinical standards. It is recommended against using benzodiazepines for more than four weeks as almost half of patients who use them daily for over a month may develop dependence. For early-night insomnia, BZDs with short or intermediate half-lives such as alprazolam; flunitrazepam, estazolam, midazolam, and bromazepam are preferred, while those with prolonged effect duration like clonazepam, diazepam, and fluorazepam can be options for maintenance and early-morning insomnia. Sublingual administration may offer faster absorption in cases of early-night insomnia.

Drug interactions; contraindications, and side effects: Drugs that interfere with CYP3A4 metabolism may influence the metabolism of BZDs. The main pharmacological interactions are with phenothiazines, opioids, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antidepressants with hypnotic effects, alcohol, illicit drugs; interaction can also occur with certain foods such as grapefruit and St. John's Wort.

BZDs may exacerbate symptoms like respiratory depression, incoordination, imbalance, behavioral changes, sleepiness. Therefore, their use is not recommended for patients with myasthenia gravis, ataxic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic respiratory failure, CNS depressant intoxication, angle-closure glaucoma, older people presenting agitation or psychiatric comorbidities.

The most common side effects include daytime sleepiness, lethargy, fatigue; impaired attention and concentration; amnesia, abuse, dependence, withdrawal, hypotonia, ataxia; falls, fractures, accidents, memory impairment, increased risk of paradoxical reactions in older people.
