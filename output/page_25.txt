systematic review With meta-analysis gathered data from 2,271 patients across four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), showing that 50 mg of daridorexant was superior to placebo for the four efficacy outcomes: wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency, subjective insomnia severity scale (IST) and Insomnia Daytime Symptoms & Impacts Questionnaire domain score. Additionally, there were no significant differences in adverse events between daridorexant and placebo.

Daridorexant is effective and safe for the treatment of insomnia when compared with placebo.
Drug interactions, contraindications, and side effects: The most common side effects are sleepiness, fatigue; headache; and nasopharyngitis. Lemborexant, a new DORA used to treat adults and older people with insomnia characterized by sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance difficulties, was approved in 2019 for use in the United States, Japan, and Canada.

Available presentations: Lemborexant is available as 5 mg and 10 mg oral tablets.
Patient assessment: It is indicated for treating sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia in adults and older people. Use in children, adolescents, pregnant women, or during breastfeeding is not recommended.
Therapeutic planning: The recommended dose is 5 mg administered at bedtime, at least 7 hours before the planned wake-up time; a dosage of 10 mg may be increased based on clinical response and tolerability.

Expected outcomes: In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with objective and subjective assessments, lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg provided efficacy with minimal residual sleepiness in adult and older participants. Individuals treated with lemborexant experienced improvements across all sleep parameters, including reduced sleep-onset latency, increased sleep efficiency, and total sleep time (TST) compared to placebo. Benefits were observed at both dosages from the first week of use and maintained for 12 continuous months.

Roth et al.'s study evaluated changes in insomnia severity over a year in 949 individuals with moderate to severe insomnia treated with lemborexant, showing reduced severity which was sustained throughout the analysis period compared to placebo. There is no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal after stopping treatment for up to 12 months.

In a randomized, double-blind study involving 1,006 participants aged 55 years and older, Rosenberg et al.'s findings indicated that lemborexant therapy significantly improved both sleep latency and maintenance compared with placebo and extended-release zolpidem. Therapy was well tolerated in older adults and effective, especially during the latter half of the night.

Doses of 5 mg and particularly 10 mg of lemborexant were beneficial for treating insomnia patients while being well-tolerated. Adverse effects are generally mild to moderate; common side effects include sleepiness, nasopharyngitis, and headache.
Uncommon adverse reactions (incidence <2%) included sleep paralysis in 1.6% and 1.3% of those receiving 10 mg and 5 mg respectively, hypnagogic hallucinations reported in 0.7% of patients who received the higher dose; no reports were noted among placebo recipients.

DORAs are not yet available in Brazil but expected to be launched soon.
Caution should still be exercised given that very few studies evaluated comorbid insomnia cases.
