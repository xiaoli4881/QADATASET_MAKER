Extending these results to this population, drug interactions between DORAs and antidepressants may occur. Suicide risk in serious patients has not been well evaluated.

This class of hypnotic is contraindicated for the treatment of insomnia in patients with narcolepsy.

Melatoninergic receptor agonists, such as Ramelteon, are approved as a chronohypnotic for treating sleep-onset insomnia by stimulating melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2). MT1 attenuates alert signals in the suprachiasmatic nucleus while MT2 synchronizes the circadian clock.

Although there are no direct comparison studies, evidence from experimental data suggests that Ramelteon is 3 to 16 times more potent than melatonin. 

Available presentations: Ramelteon is available in various doses and rapidly absorbed due to extensive first-pass metabolism involving cytochrome P450 enzymes primarily.

Patient assessment: Ramelteon can be indicated for adult patients with sleep-onset insomnia.

Therapeutic planning: The recommended administration is one tablet daily, 30 minutes before bedtime. Tablets should not be broken; there is no evidence of the need to adjust doses for specific cases.

Expected outcomes: To date, two systematic reviews (one including a meta-analysis) and several randomized studies lasting up to 12 months have evaluated Ramelteon's effect on insomnia. In that meta-analysis by Kuriyama et al., involving 5,800 patients with insomnia or insomniacsymptoms over an average follow-up duration of 38 days, Ramelteon was associated with reduced sleep latency (a weighted average difference of 4.3 minutes [95% CI: 7.01 to -1.58]) and improved sleep quality but not subjective IST increase.

Drug interactions, contraindications, and side effects: When co-administered with Ramelteon, fluvoxamine (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) significantly increased the concentration and half-life compared to when administered alone. Thus, Ramelteon should not be co-administered with fluvoxamine or other CYP2D6 inhibitors such as siprofloxacin, nor with CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole, and CYP2C19 inhibitors like fluconazole.

This medicine should not be used by pregnant women due to the lack of adequate and well-controlled studies under these conditions. The use in breastfeeding women is also not recommended. Similarly, its use in children and adolescents is not advised due to a lack of focused studies on these populations.

The most common adverse events with Ramelteon include sleepiness (5% vs 3% placebo), dizziness (5% vs 3% placebo), and fatigue (4% vs 2% placebo). Although very rare, there are reports of serious allergic reactions such as angioedema associated with its use.

Other considerations: 1) Toxicity is relatively low compared to other hypnotic agents; 2) Evidence supports safety with prolonged use without rebound insomnia in 12-month studies; 3) Safety has been confirmed for older patients and those with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Exogenous melatonin, marketed for about 30 years, is a chronobiotic suitable for circadian rhythm disorders. However, it has erroneously become one of the most used substances in the world to induce sleep.

Mechanism of action: Endogenous and exogenous melatonin act on the sleep-wake cycle by stimulating MT1 receptors (attenuating alert signals) and MT2 receptors (synchronizing the circadian clock).

Available presentations: Exogenous melatonin is marketed in various forms, including immediate-release tablets (2 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg), sublingual usetablets (0.21 mg), drops (0.21 mg/drop), and formulations available for compounding pharmacy marketing.

In oral immediate-release formulations, exogenous melatonin reaches maximum plasma concentration around 50 minutes with low and variable bioavailability due to hepatic metabolism followed by urinary excretion. The half-life is approximately 60 minutes (40-90 minutes).
