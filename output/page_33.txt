Therapeutic Planning:
- Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.): Package inserts suggest administering 50 to 300 ng of standardized valerian extract, 30 to 60 minutes before going to bed. The tablet should not be broken.
- Passiflora (Passiflora incarnata Linnaeus): No scientific guidelines exist for therapeutic planning.

Expected Outcomes:
- Valerian: A systematic review with meta-analysis demonstrated inconsistent valerian effects due to the irregularity and variability of extract quality used. Nonetheless, significant adverse events were observed in evaluated populations.
- Passiflora: A placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT showed increased Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores with polysomnography in patients taking Passiflora extracts for 2 weeks.

Drug Interactions, Contraindications, and Side Effects:
- Valerian: No residual effects or serious adverse events were observed. Rebound insomnia after discontinuation was not reported.
- Passiflora: Herbal products should not be used by pregnant or breastfeeding women due to lack of adequate safety studies in these conditions.

Mechanism of Action (Passiflora):
- Modulates GABAergic activity, possibly exerting a sedative effect.

Available Presentations:
- Valerian and Passiflora can be found in capsules, tablets, or compounding presentations with variable quantities and different flavonoid concentrations. Liquid formulations are also available for both.
- Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.): Mechanism of action possibly involves modulating GABAergic activity.

Mechanism of Action:
- Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L. Dunal): Possibly exerts sedative effects by modulating GABAergic activity.

Available Presentations and Patient Assessment for Ashwagandha, Chamomile, and Mulungu:
- Compounding presentations can be found in capsules with 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract.
- No scientific guidelines exist indicating the use of chamomile or mulungu to treat insomnia disorders.

Mechanism of Action (Ashwagandha):
- Modulates GABAergic activity, possibly exerting sedative effects.

Expected Outcomes:
- Ashwagandha: A placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT demonstrated that ashwagandha treats insomnia. There were improvements in actigraphy parameters and sleep quality.
- Mulungu (Anadenanthera colubrina): No study has assessed the effects of mulungu on any sleep-related outcome.

Drug Interactions:
- Passiflora: Possibly enhances the effect of barbiturates; concomitant use is not recommended. Interaction with coumarin medications such as Warfarin suggests no concurrent use.
- Chamomile and Mulungu: No significant adverse effects have been described from using these extracts.

Mechanism of Action (Mulungu):
- The mechanism has not yet been described.

Patient Assessment:
- Ashwagandha, chamomile, and mulungu show no scientific guidelines for treating insomnia or comorbid conditions.
