Each working group received a selection of articles resulting from the systematic reviews specifically related to treating primary chronic insomnia. Additional literature and package inserts of selected drugs were consulted at discretion by each critical review team.

All interventions were voted on in three standardized manners: 1) as treatment for sleep-onset insomn ia; 2) as treatment for sleep-maintenance insomnia and early waking; and 3) as treatment for insomnia during pregnancy and breastfeeding (only in round #2). In all cases, the interventions were considered primary treatments for adults with no comorbidities. All sentences to be voted on were written positively.

No specific recommendations were made regarding posology or route of administration except for zolpidem, which was independently evaluated across four different presentations: oral, sublingual; controlled release; and orodispersible. Each working group compiled a list of special recommendations for each intervention and diagnosis, including relevant topics such as populations, comorbidities, characteristics, insomnia phenotypes, posology, etc.

Special recommendations were voted on to determine their direction (in favor or against). These votes assessed the level of consensus using the Delphi method. Practical recommendations were evaluated by all task force members on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (totally agree) to 5 (totally disagree), with consensus reached when at least 75% agreed either positively or negatively. Items without initial agreement underwent a second round, adapted as necessary.

Only physicians voted on pharmacological treatment recommendations; all participants voted on non-pharmacological treatments, but psychologists' votes had triple weight. All professionals participated in voting for diagnostic-related recommendations.
