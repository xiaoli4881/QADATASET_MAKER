concentrations of 45 to 60 minutes. Controlled-release Pre-sentations have biphasic absorption, with rapid initial ab-sorption and prolonged plasma concentration, lasting morethan 3 hours. 128
Available presentations: In Brazil,avallable presentationsinclude immediate-release tablets, 1018; sublingual, 5mgand 10mg;51g and 10mg orodispersible; controlled-re-lease tablets Of 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg; oral solution 10 mglmL128(0.5 mgldrop ).
Patient assessment: it is indicated for acute night Sleep-onset insomnia (immediate releasedose Of 5 to 10 mg) andfOI sleep maintenance (prolonged releasedose Of 6.25 mg)in adults. For older adults, it is recommended to start withhalf this dose。The initial dose should be lower for Women.Use for children, adolescents; pregnant women, Or duringbreastfeeding is not recommended.
Therapeutic planing: Shouldbe administeredat bedtime, oVer Io more than 4 Weeks. 129
Expected outcomnes: I a meta-analysis (n = 1,068 ), Zolpi-dem resulted in increased ISI, reduced sleep latency, andimproved sleep quality,withno difference讧WASO. 129Evaluating different doses Of zolpidem (5; 7.5; 10; 15; and2018), i Was shown that doses Of 7.5 and 10 mg decreasedsleep-onset latency and the number Of nighttime wakes andincreasedTSI,Withoutimpact01psychomotorperformance. 130
Comparing sublingualandOralZolpidem,1018,thesublingual presentationreduced sleepOnsetlatency by8.6 minutes, with no differences in IST and WASO, comparedWith oralzolpidem. 131 In individuals With chronic insomnia,oral (10mg) and sublingual (5mg) zolpidem led to a similarreduction in the number of wakes and an increase in TSI, butwithagreater reduction in sleep latency with sublingualzolpidem. 132
For nalntenance insomnla, With nighttinle Wakes, SUb-lingual zolpidem (5mg) increased TSI, Without significantchanges in sleep latency, WASO, or sleep quality, and withsleepiness and reduced alertness in the morning. 133
Extended-release Zolpidem ( 12.518), i individuals Withchronic insomnia, increased TST and sleep efficiency, Whilereducing latency to persistent sleep, wakes, and WASO. Thefollowing morning; there Was no impairment Of psychomotOI performance. 134,135
Drug interactions; contraindications; and Side eljects:zolpidemis metabolized by cytochrome(CYP):Usewith CYP3A4 inhibitors (fuvoxamine; ciprofloxacin andketoconazole )isnot recommended duetothe potentialincrease i the sedative effect。 Use with CYP3A4 iducers(rifampicin andSt。 John'swort)decrease zolpidemlevels。0450may
Side ettects of zolpidem include sleepiness ( 5%), dizziness(5%), headache (3%), gastrointestinal symptoms (4%), sleep-Walking (1%), nightmares (1-2%), and mental confusion (1-2%).128,131,132,135 The risk Of falls and fractures is increased,128especially among older people。Non-REM (NREM) sleepparasomnias, and behavioral changes (disinhibition, aggres-siveness; impulsivity, Visualand auditory hallucinations;driving) are possible effects, more prevalent i association
With alcohol.128 There is an increased risk Of suicide; espe-cially with high doses and psychiatric comorbidities. 128 Theprevalence Of rebound insomniawithdiscontinuationOfzolpidem Was not greater than that observed with placeboafter daily use for one year, 136 but i may be observed withabrupt discontinuation Of higher doses. 128
Zolpidem Can Cause dependence syndrome. Abrupt inter-ruption is associatedWith headache; myalgia, irritability,anxiety, mental confusion, and, in more serious cases, dere-alization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, hypersensitivity tolight, noise, and tactile stimuli, hallucinations, and epilepticseizures. There has been a recent increase in zolpidem abuseand theuSe Of high doses, with tolerance; particularly iindividuals with reported dependence and abuse Of otherdrugs. 137 In Brazil, between 2018 and 2022, there Was a161%growth in zolpidem sales, reaching; almost 22 million boxessoldin 2022, according to data provided by the NationalControlled Products Management System, managed by theNational Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). In this sameperiod, comparatively, the sale Of clonazepam increased byjust over 9%. Iherefore; measures to combat indiscriminateUSe, as Well as the correct assessment and reassessment ofpatients during theuse Of zolpidem;arePriorities in thetreatment Of patients。
Mechanism af action: It is3non-benzodiazepine hypnoticagentfrom the cyclopyrrolone family. It has a highaffinity foIthe Q-1and 4-2 subunits Of the GABA-A receptor: 128 Afteroral administration, zopicloneis rapidly absorbed;withmaximunplasmaconcentrationsOf30andG0nglmLreached within 1.5 to 2 hours, after administration Of 3.75and 7.51g; respectively. Its terminal elimination half-life(t1/2) is ~5 hour:
Available presentations: Zopiclone is available in Brazilinthe form Of 7.5 Ig coated tablets. 128
PatientQssessmhent:Duet0its mechanismOf actionzopiclone is indicated for adult patients with acute; onset;andlor maintenance insomnia。 Older people shouldstartWith half the dosage (3.75 ng).
Therapeutic plannig: Ihe recommended administrationis1tablet, orally, only at bedtime (considering that thepatient must adopt a regular pattern in the times they g0to bed and get u). Treatment should be short-term, tryingnot to exceed 4 weeks。
