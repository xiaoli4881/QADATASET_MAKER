Drvg interactiols, contraidicatiols, Side ejjects: EXOg-enous melatonin administration is considered quite safe irelation to potential drug interactions, risk Of intoxication;abuse potential, and significant shortand medium-term sideeffects.206 The most common adverse events reported areheadaches and sleepiness. 207
ExOgenousIelatonln Shouldnot beused by PregnantWomen as it crosses the placental barrier, and there are noadequate and well-controlled studies under these condi-tions. TheUSe Of this medicine in Women Who are breastfeeding is likewise not recommended。
Clinical Observations: As a chronobiotic, exogenous melatonin delays or advances phases in the sleep-wake cycle;depending on the time Wheni is administered. Delayedphases can occurif it is ingested around the end of the usualsleep period; andadvanced phases When ingested3to5 hours before the usual sleep onset. 218,219
Other Considerations: Insome countries, including讧Brazil, exogenous melatonin has been released by regulatoryagencies as a food supplementand is therefore not subject tothe same quality rules Of drugs。 In 2017, after testing 30different typesOf exogenousmelatoninsold讥CanadaErland andSaxena reported disagreements between labelspecifcations and formulation contentlarge differences intheactualamount of melatonin, presence ofserotoninin 26%Of formulations, addition Of herbal extracts and Variationsbetween lots Of the same manufacturer. 220
The use of sedative antidepressants to treat Chronic insomniais Widespread, but none is approved forinsomnia by ANVISA.Hence; its prescription is considered off-label and based onscientifc evidence Of non-systematized trials, Which limitsthe powerOf generalizing their effectiveness 221,222 Thisunlicensed medicineUSe Can be motivated by concern forthe prolonged use ofhypnotics and the limited availability Ofpsychological treatments. Although few studies evaluate theeffect of antidepressants on insomnia symptoms, With limit-ed sampling; short-term follow-up, and design limitations;
the long-term safety profile of antidepressants makes themempirically chosen, insteadOf other medications, for thetreatment Of chronic insomnia.221,222 High-quality antide-pressants for insomnia treatment are required. It is impor-tanttoclarifythatindicatingtheUSeofsedativeantidepressantstotreat insomniais independent Of thepresenceOfpsychiatric comorbidityandthat the dosesused for this purposearesignifcantly lower thanthoseOriginally recommended to treat depression. 20,223
Mechanism0faction:IricyClic   antidepressant;whosemechanismn Of action asAhantidepressant is to block thereuptake Of monoaminergic neurotransmitters for Pre-Syn-aptic terminals, having anticholinergic activity and modu-the antagonismOfhistamine (珏)41andreceptors.

Avallable presentations: Doxepin Is aVallable 1 BrazllOnly for compounding in registered pharmacies upon specif-ic prescription. As it is an FDA-approved drug for insomniatreatment, the usually recommended dose should be that ofthe same industrialized presentation in the United Statesie。,3 and 618.19,20
Patient assessment: Due to pharmacokinetic Characteristics, doxepin can be indicated for different clinicalinsomniaphenotypes in adults and can, therefore, be used in sleep-Onset and maintenance insomnia and early Waking: 19,20,221Ihereare10specific contraindicationsfor differentagegroups and can also be used in adults over 65 years. 222,223
