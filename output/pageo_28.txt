Mechanism 0f action: It is an antidepressant Whose Iech-anism Of action is itsperformance as an agonist in MTI andMT2 receptors and antagonist actions in histaminergic (H)receptors SH2C。
Available presentations: It is available i Brazil in 25 Ig~coated tablets。
Patient assessment: There are I0 RCTs With any meth-odology assessing agomelatine specifically in the treatmentOf insomnia without comorbidities. Some publications evalUate the outcomes Of sleep quality in patients With depres-sion treated With agomelatine 221,231,232 Thus; there are Iospecific recommendations for the evaluation of patients withinsomnia treated With agomelatine。
Therapeutic Planning: The 25 1g initial dose to treatdepression with agomelatine should be recommended whengoing to bed, planning to increase doses to 50 mg When going
t0bedafter4weeks,讧the persistenceOf depressivesymptoms。
Expected outcomes: A 24-week; double-blind, controlledrandomized study evaluated the efficacy of agomelatine andescitalopram in depression and subjective sleep perceptions讧patients with major depression. It reported a subjectiveimprovement in sleep-onset latency but did not find differ-ences between escitalopram and agomelatine in relation tosleep latency in 12 and 24 weeks 232Areview that broughttogether the results Of three randomized studies comparingagomelatinewithselective serotonin reuptake inhibitorantidepressants Or Venlafaxine established that agomelatineincreasesSIOW-waVesleep; improves sleep efficiency ipatients With major depressive disorder While not changingREM sleep amount or latency.233
Drvg interactions, contralndications, Side effects, andobservations: Agomelatine is metabolized by cytochrome1a2(CYPIA2) (90%)and CYP2C9/19 (10%).Othermedications that interact With these isoenzymes may de-CreaseO[increase the bioavailabilityOf agomelatine。IShouldnotbe usedi associationWith other medicinessuch as fluvoxamine, estrogens, and ciprofloxacin, as theyCan modify their serum level,as wellaSpropranolol, andexaggerated smoking: 223At the 25m8 dose;the averagemaximum concentrationWaS24t013 times higher forpatients aged > 75 years compared with patients75years.

Other considerations: Whenused j the treatment0fmajor depression, agomelatine can improve subjective andobjective  sleep parametersWhencomparedWithotherantidepressants。
Mechanism ofaction: Ihe ettect of trazodone as a hypnoticIs duetoits moderate antihistamine activityi theH1receptor, and its partial agonism in the hydroxytryptaminereceptor (HI) 5HT1a.233 As an antidepressant, i promotesSHTIC and 5HT2 receptor antagonism and post-synaptic a1一adrenergic receptor antagonism.221,233 It also exerts rela-tively weak, although specific reuptake inhibition, acting Onthe 5-HT carrier. Thus, trazodone is classified as serotoninantagonist ZAIZC and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Trazo-done doses lower than those effective for antidepressiveaction are often used for the effective treatment of insomniaLOWdoses explore powerful trazodone actionas SHT2aantagonist, as Wellas its properties as an antagonist Of HIand al-adrenergichistamine receptors, but do notadequate-Iy explore their properties Of serotonin carrier inhibition OISHT2C receptors, Which are Weaker:.221,231
Available presentations: Trazodone is available in 50 mgand100 mg immediate-releaseand15018and30018extended-release presentations. Importantly, extended-re-lease presentations minimize the Known sedative effect Ofthe drug.221,231
