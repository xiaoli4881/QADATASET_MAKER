Mechanism ofaction: Amitriptyline is commonly used Off-label for insomnia because Of its sedative properties. Likeother tricyclic antidepressants,its  antidepressant actionmechanismis to block reuptake bombs Of serotonin andnorepinephrine neurotransmitters. Sedative properties arecaused by antagonism On muscarinic-cholinergic receptors;al-adrenergic,and histaminergic; being presentin low dosesSuChaS1018:Ihe antidepressant effect requires dosesgreater than 75 mg/day to recruit serotonergic and norad-237renergic receptors.
Available presentations: AmitriptylineIsaVailable讧10 ng, 25118, and 75 mg tablets。
Patient assessment: No RCTIas assessed amitriptyline tOtreat specifically insomnia with no comorbidities. Therefore;there are Iospecific recommendations for the evaluation 0-patients With insomnia in treatment With amitriptyline。

Drug iteractions, contraindications, and Side effects:Amitriptyline is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome 0450206 enzymes. CombinedUSeOf amitriptyline With othernerVOUSsystem depressors increases the risk Of sedation toataxia. Oral contraceptives, selective serotonin inhibitors,antipsychotics, and acetylsalicylic acid reuptake increasetheserum levels Of amitriptyline。UseWith medicationsthat extend the QT interval should be avoided due to theSynergistic effect of amitriptyline in this condition.
