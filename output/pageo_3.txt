Whose patients have complaints and symptoms compatiblewiththis  sleepdisorder:Thus; this guideline aimedtoprovide patient-centered clinical guidelines withaStrUCtured methodology。The fnalresult isa1objective andPractical document that provides recommendations to Pro-fessionalsWho manage insomnia with the best scientificsupport available。
Even though this paper covers both the diagnosis and treatment Of insomnia, structured research questions were de-Veloped only for the topics on treatment, not for the ones oninsomnia diagnosis. Developing research questions for diag-nostic accuracy 一suchas With the PI(R)T approachrequires14clearly established reference testsas Valid comparators。Since the reference tests are analyzed in this study, the topicsOn diagnosiswere not addressed with structured researchquestionsrather, these topicswereWrittenbased01theoretical considerations, previous guidelines, and profes-sional experience. The same is true about topics related topathophysiological aspects and insomnia classification。
Hence; a series ofquestions were developed tor the tOpICson insomnia treatment based on the PICO acronym, follow-ing the model, "What is the effect of [INTERVENTIONI com-pared with [CONTROL] on [OUTCOME] in adults with chronicinsomnia without comorbidities?." Each PICO parameter Wasdefined by the steering committee in a synchronous onlinemeeting: Concerning pharmacological interventions, onlythe ones currently available in Brazil Or possibly becomingaVailable in the upcoming years Were considered eligible。Given the large number of interventions to be included ithis paper, it Was decided to restrict the research questions tothe primary treatment Of chronic insomnia in adults. Otheraspects relatedto theUSeand implementationOf eachselected intervention (e.8., different insomnia phenotypes,comorbidities, combined treatment, etc. ) were not includedin the research questions, althoughare discussed in thereviews prepared by eachWork group. The list Of eligibleinterventions is presented i~Table 1. Each PICO item isthey
detailed 讥Table 2 and explained i detail along With theinclusion and exclusion criteria。
The results of the systematic reviews basedOn theresearch questionswereusedWithtWOmain purposes:1Generating materialto analyzethe level of evidencefOreach intervention and 2. Providing references to each workSroup to help them prepare their reviews. No meta-analyseswere performed。
Bibliographic Search and Eligibility AnalysisIndependent search strategies were developed for each interVention (as seen iTable 1 ). Exceptions were made in thefollowing three cases: 1.interventions related to cannabinoidsand cognitive-behavioral therapy applied to insomnia (CBT-I),fOr Whichageneral searchWas made for each group;2alternativeand complementary interventions;Of Which让Was decidednot to conduct systematic reviews due to thegreat heterogeneity in studies using these treatments; and 3_phytotherapy interventions (Matricaria recutita and Withaniasomnifera), Of Which no systematic reviewsWere conductedbecause they Were included later in this document。
The strategies combinedtWO search domains one forinsomnia (addressing both population and outcome) andthe other combining each intervention's search strategy。Regardingspecifcallynon-pharmacologicalinterven-tions, the search strategies were limited to CBT-I,accep-tance and commitment therapy applied to insomnia (ACT-[), andmindfulness-based cognitive therapy appliedtoinsomnia (MBCT-I).
