Expected outcomes: Quetiapine has been approved bytheFDAfor thetreatmentOf schizophreniaandIanicepisodes and as an adjuvant treatment for major depressiveepisodes. Quetiapine has been used, i Off-label prescrip-tion,totreat insomnia;andstudieshave evaluatedtheeffectiveness Of treatment and sleep impact 243,248,249I2010,an RCT evaluated the use Of 25 mg quetiapine at nightfor the treatment Of primary insomnia.250In this study;thereWas10statistically significant difference讥sleepparametersSuChas IST and sleep latency in relationtothe placebo group .250 Since then, other studies have beendeveloped。Areview published讧2009 suggestedthatquetiapine could reduce sleep-onset latency and improveIST and sleep efficiency in patients with psychiatric dis-orders, but findings are still insufficient to propose it asapharmacological option in the treatment of insomnia with-Outpsychiatric comorbidities. 248 Meta-analysis resultslished in 2023 point out that quetiapine, in doses lower thanthosein thetreatment of schizophrenia oracute manicepisodes; effectively managed insomnia.249 However, theauthors point out that long-term effectiveness and safetyneedto be investigated, especially in groups Of patientswithoutpsychiatric disorders.249 According to a meta-anal-ysis, doses ranging from 50-150 mg/day are recommended,particularly for symptoms Of insomnia in comorbidity Withgeneralizedanxietydisorderandmajordepressive249episodes。Pub-used

Other considerations: 1 ) Despite the further cited andrecently developed studies, other ones are needed with moreindividuals, evaluating the effect Of continuous treatmentand response profile in insomnia Without comorbidity; 2) itis always necessary to consider risks associated With adverseeffects When prescribingantipsychotic for other purposes; 3 )the safety and effectiveness Of quetiapine were not estab-lished for childrenand adolescents ( 10 to 17 years old); 4)theSafety and effectiveness Of quetiapine during human preg-nancyWerenot established; 5) thereare reportsOn theexcretion Of quetiapine in breast milk during breastfeeding:However, the levelof excretion Was not consistently detect-ableat low doses suchas thoseto treat insomnia。According to records in the package leaflet of manufacturingindustries; women Who are breastfeeding should be advisedtO prevent breastfeeding While using quetiapine. Still, theCenter for Programmatic and Strategic Actions of the De-partmentofHealthcare Of the Brazilian Ministry ofHealth, inits publication on breastfeeding and the use of medicines andother substances,253States that theUSeOf quetiapine iscompatible with lactation, at the discretion of the prescrib-ing physician, given the risk-benefit assessment。used
Ihe anti-epileptic drugs, Previously named anticonvulsantsincluded in this manuscript are: gabapentin and pregabalin。
Mechanism ofaction: Gabapentin has a structure analo-gOUSto the inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) and;al-though its mechanism Of action is notunderstood, 让inhibits theactionOf a-2delta subunits Of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibiting calciumCurrentsand decreasing neuronal excitability。fully
