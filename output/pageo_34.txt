Mechanism aJ action: They act as inverse agonists ratherthan H1 (histamine) receptor antagonists. The effects on theCNSare basically determined byits ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to central HI receptors. The ability tocrOss the blood-brain barrier will depend on the lipophilicquality Of the molecule and affinity With P-glycoprotein。Furthermore; it has anticholinergic, a-adrenergic, and sero-tonergic actions. 269

Antihistamines may increase the arrhyth-mogenic effect Of psychotic agents and should be used withcautionin patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Smallerdoses in addition to cautious use are recommended i theelderly due to the greater potential foranticholinergic effectsand sedation. Dosages should be reduced in liver failure。
In recent years, ABS has been Very active 讥 implementingguidelines andrecommendationsfOramultidisciplinaryapproachto sleep disorders. 273 This document presentedthecurrent evidence forthe diagnosis andtreatment of
insomnia i adults after carrying out standardized researchProcesses and discussions and voting sessions. The relevanceOfahappropriate diagnosis thatWill guidecOrrectandcomprehensive treatment is clear。We highlight CBT-IaSthe therapy Of choice for most patients in this document。We also highlight the evidence for each pharmacologicalclass that is frequently used in the treatment Of insomniadisorder or insomnia symptoms. Highlighting selective ben-zodiazepine receptor agonists (treatment of sleep-onset andmaintenanceinsomnia  depending01thepresentation ),DORAs (treatment of sleep-onset and maintenance insom-nia), and melatoninergic agonists (treatment Of sleep-onsetinsomnia ) due to a greater number Of evidence in favor Oftheir respectiveUSeS。We also showed the possibilityOftreatmentWith antidepressantsin specific situationOfinsomniacomorbidwithm00ddisorders (althoughIoreevidence is still needed)。
However, i is inportant to emphasize that, i Clinicalpractice;, we observe little emphasis on non-pharmacolog-ical measures offeredtOpatients with insomnia。In fact;CBT-Iis often not used, and the health professionallpatientbinomial ends Up placing much Of the success on pharma-cological treatment, often Without a defined plan for theduration Of use andlor withdrawal attempts. Furthermore;thereis frequentUSeOf off-labelsubstancesand101-treatment Of comorbid conditions that are clearly influ-encing theCOUrSeandseverity Of insomnia。Allthesefactors have contributed to repeated cases of dependenceand abuse Of some of the available pharmacological treat-ments. Thus,wehope that this document can be Of greatUSeS0 that health professionals can improve the care Ofinsomnia, a clinical condition that has multiple individualand societal consequences。
